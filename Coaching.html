	<h1 style="font-family:calibri">What exactly is VALORANT?</h1>
	<h3 style="font-family:calibri">VALORANT is a team-based tactical shooter, where the "attacker's" objective is to make their way to one of the two (or three) bomb sites to plant the "spike". On the other hand, the "defenders" have to prevent the attackers from planting the explosive, and if they do get the bomb down, defuse it before it explodes. The FPS game uses some elements from the popular FPS game Counter Strike : Global Offensive, as well as others from Overwatch. To be precise, VALORANT uses the gun and movement mechanics that is used in Counter Strike and the unique abilities concept that come from Overwatch. Rating - 4/5 Stars ESRB Rating - T (Teen, 13+)</h3>
	<br>
	<h1 style="font-family:calibri">Who Would This Help Specifically?</h1>
	<h3 style="font-family:calibri">The strategies that are going to be explained will mainly pertain to those in the middle ranks of VALORANT (Gold 3-Platinum 3). As you move up in rank, it is best to learn these different things to help you as you rank up, as these will become more commonly used in the upper echelon of the game. Due to this, you will want to at least have an idea of what to do whenever your team wants to do one of the these strategies. Some of these items will also help with certain situations in which you are in a one vs. x amount of players scenario, which will enable a higher chance of winning the round.</h3>
	<br>
	<h1 style="font-family:calibri">The Different Strategies</h1>
	<h3 style="font-family:calibri">In VALORANT, there are multiple strategies that you can utilize in the game depending on the situation. Examples of this would be defaulting, playing for the spike, team utility combos, bomb rushing, site retakes, etc. However, executing these strategies can be very difficult to actually pull off. Team economy may also dictate what you do in a round, as you may not have the credits to buy all utility with a gun and heavy shields. This guide will elaborate on some of the simple but hard techniques or strategies that can be utilized in VALORANT.</h3>
	<br>
	
	<h2 style="font-family:calibri">Repositioning</h2>
	<p style="font-family:calibri">Like any other FPS game, repositioning in VALORANT is vital to being able to win a round or match. By repositioning yourself into a different angle or even a different spot on the site, you can catch your enemies off-guard. For example, if you are an attacker, you will find yourself defending the spike after you plant it. If you manage to get kill an enemy, chances are their other teammates will know that you are, let's say back-site. Due to this, repositioning to a different place will help you get some more frags and possibly more space to work with.</p>

	<h2 style="font-family:calibri">Faking the Defuse</h2>
	<p style="font-family:calibri">Although the main objective of the defender side is to defend the site and defuse the spike, sometimes you can use the sound queue of the bomb being defused to your advantage. This is somewhat easy to do, as all you want to do is tap, or press the button to defuse, the bomb and reposition. This will help tempt the attacker to peek out because they will need to stop you from defusing. If done correctly, you will have guaranteed yourself a win.</p>

	<h2 style="font-family:calibri">Rotating (Attacker Sided)</h2>
	<p style="font-family:calibri">You may have heard of the term "rotating" before, but in a nutshell, it is when you leave the site you are currently at/going to and run to the other. In this section, we will be covering the attacker sided rotation. Typically, you will do this when either A, you are making noise at the site to trick the enemies into thinking you are actually attacking that site, or B which is the more likely scenario, the whole enemy team is at the site you are attacking. If you experience scenario B, then you should take some things into account first before rotating. Do you 100% know that most if not all of the enemy team is there? Do you think your team has the utility capable of taking the site from four to five people? If you know that they are there and you do not have the utility to overtake the site, then rotating is likely to be the most viable option.</p>

	<h2 style="font-family:calibri">Five-Man Rush (Bomb Rush)</h2>
	<p style="font-family:calibri">As the name intends, a five-man rush, or bomb rush, is where your entire team goes towards one site very fast. This is best used on the pistol round (first round) of each half. This is because the defenders will have less utility to work with since they are likely to buy a sidearm and only one or two pieces of utility. However, this does not mean it is limited to that. In fact, when the enemy team is on an eco round (a round where a team cannot buy a full load out and have to "save" credits), a bomb rush is really strong since they have much less than what you may have. Not only that, this simple strategy is still usable on rounds where everyone has some sort of rifle because it can easily overwhelm those who are defending the bomb site. Additionally, it should also be in your best interest to not push too far into the enemy. This is because if you are killed, then it is likely that no one will be there to trade you. As a result, it will give the opponents a higher chance to win the round because your team will have lost a teammate who could have helped defend the planted spike.</p>

	<h2 style="font-family:calibri">Split Push</h2>
	<p style="font-family:calibri">When playing on the attacker side, sometimes it is best to do what is called a "Split Push". As said in the name, the point of this strategy is to pinch (attacking both the left and right of the defenders) the site you are attempting to take control of. By doing this, you are able to easily take the site and play post-plant against the defenders. However, this also requires more teamwork compared to the other strategies because you have to time everything correctly without being too slow.</p>
