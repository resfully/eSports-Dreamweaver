		<a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2022/11/riot-games-new-emea-valorant-game-changers-format-2023">Article - VALORANT Game Changers EMEA unveils new format and structure for 2023</a>
		<br>
1) VALORANT Game Changers in the EMEA circuit is set to have a number of changes going into the 2023 season. It is with this new format that new players in the region will have a new and possible path to becoming a professional player in the game. The renewed circuit will be divided into four tiers: VCT Game Changers EMEA: Emergents and VCT Game Changers EMEA: Academy, VCT Game Changers Contenders, VCT Game Changers EMEA, and finally the Game Changers Championships. According to Riot themselves, the new format aims to grow the Game Changers Community and continue to bolster the esports ecosystem for women and other gender minorities.
<br>
2) a. The message is conveyed very well and is easy to understand.
    b. It stays relatively on the surface-level of things, however does go a little in depth       about each series.
    c. Something that was interesting about the article was how the Game Changers side compares to the normal VCT, as the former uses a different format than that of the latter.</p>

		<a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2022/09/riot-games-unveils-full-list-of-valorant-champions-tour-off-season-tournaments">Article - Riot Games unveils full list of VALORANT Champions Tour off-season tournaments</a>
		<br>
		1) The article talks about the newly created VALORANT OFF//SEASON initiative, which aims to give third-party tournament organizers a way to host tournaments outside of their regular campaign. So tournaments such as the Knights Arena, which was originally an unofficial tournament that was not connected to Riot Games, will be able to hold it on a professional level. Because of these various [25] tournaments are off-season in multiple regions, this will allow, "...Riot to keep the VALORANT scene alive during the off-season, a time where roster moves and speculations usually happen. It will also allow tournament organizers to experiment more with formats and types of events, which will hopefully lead to interesting matches year-round."
		<br>
		2) It is a good article because it goes in depth on how it will be beneficial for not only tournament organizers but also the competitive season itself. Specifically, it will keep the scene alive throughout the off-season, as not much goes on aside from roster changes and such. It will also allow tournament organizers to have support from Riot themselves, as they will provide a dedicated information page about them as well as tips and advice on how to create your very own events.</p>

		<a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2023/01/fpx-valorant-rebrand-china">Article - FPX rebrands ZHUQUE team ahead of VALORANT China launch</a>
		<br>
		1) Having joined the VALORANT EU scene in 2020, the original FPX roster managed to claim a VCT Masters title and finished in the Top 4 of the 2022 Champions tournament. Despite this however, FPX was not able to make franchising in any region. Much like the former, the ZHUQUE team was also launched in 2020 in Asia as an official team, and has competed in low tier invitationals. And, as VALORANT is set to be launched in China, FPX signed the former ZHUQUE roster to compete under the FPX banner ahead of the release. However, this means that FPX will now be competing in the Asia scene rather than the EMEA region.
		<br>
	2) The article is very easy to understand, as it gives the more important details as well as some background on the ZHUQUE roster. It does stay surface level, however it is a good thing as it keeps the article easy to understand and rather minimalistic. Something that was interesting about the article was FPX's move to Asia ahead of VALORANT's launch in China. This is because they did very well in EMEA, and for how popular they were during the 2022 VCT season, could have easily signed players who did not get signed by a franchised team.</p>

		<a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2022/12/amazon-riot-games-re-load">Article - Amazon partners with Riot Games to host VALORANT community event</a>
		<br>
1) The Amazon company decided to team up with Riot Games to host the first RE//LOAD tournament, will teams consisting of pros and content creators alike. It is to also feature musical performances from Dabin and Mike Times during the LAN event. This is only an addition to what Amazon has been doing to increase their presence in the esports industry, as it has collabed with Riot Games multiple times before. It has also partnered with tournament organizer BLAST for it's Apex Legends event last year in July.
<br>
2) It is fairly easy to understand and the message is clearly conveyed to the target audience that it is intended for. It does however stay surface level, as it did not reveal much about where the event was taking place and who was partaking in the event. Aside from this, it does state that the tournament could be watch online on Twitch Prime's Crown channel. Something that is interesting about the article is who was mentioned to have been confirmed to participate in the event, as Stewie2k and Shroud are both former CS:GO pro players who were infamous for their high skill.</p>

		<a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2022/11/one-esports-sea-valorant-invitational-afreecatv">Article - ONE Esports teams up with AfreecaTV to host SEA VALORANT invitational</a>
		<br>
1) eSports media company ONE Esports has announced that they will be hosting an invitational event in the Southeast Asia region alongside the Korean-based streaming service, AfreecaTV. The tournament will be a part of the official off-season circuit for the VALORANT Champions Tour, which aims to give third-party organizers a chance to host tournaments outside of the VCT circuit. In the invitational, there will be 16 SEA teams competing for upwards to $25,000 USD in prize money. Some of these teams include partnered teams, such as BOOM Esports, XERXIA, Alter Ego, and RRQ. Eight teams will be able to qualify from four groups with playoffs using a single-elimination type bracket.
<br>
2) The article is easy to understand and the message is somewhat conveyed clearly to the audience. It does go in depth as to what the prize was and some of the teams that were competing in the tournament. It also says who will be streaming the event and where the news coverage would be (One Esports). Something that is interesting about the article was who was actually partaking in the event. The franchised teams who will be in the event are some of the teams that did the best in SEA last year, such as BOOM, so it will be interesting to see how they do in the tournament, especially with the roster changes they made.</p>

		<a href="	  https://esportsinsider.com/2022/11/2022-overwatch-league-playoffs-viewership-increase">Article - 2022 Overwatch League Playoffs records significant viewership increase</a>
		<br>
1) As the 2022 Overwatch League Playoffs have come to a close, it has been reported that the event was one of the most-watched tournaments in the game's history. According to sources, the event peaked at about 397,000 viewers and 216,000 average viewers excluding Chinese viewers. This comes after a steady decrease in the franchise's viewership in recent years, in which not a single Overwatch event had surpassed 150,000 viewers prior to finals. The 2022 Playoffs managed to just come 50,000 viewers short of setting a record high, which the 2018 Inaugural event holds to this day.
<br>
2) The article is easy to understand and the message is conveyed very clearly to the readers. It goes in-depth on the viewers and how different factors attributed to the increase of viewers for the event and where it stands in terms of how it compares to past tournaments. Something that was interesting about the article was the numbers that the Playoffs managed to pull off. As stated on the website, it was able to almost become the most viewed event the franchise had ever seen and was more than double/triple in viewers compared to past events.</p>

		<a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2023/01/giants-ceo-vct-emea-interview">Article - The sleeping Giants of VCT EMEA</a>
		<br>
1) With the newly revamped VCT format now enforced, some teams from each region were able to make it into the franchising league. This includes spanish organization Giants, who have been active in the VALORANT scene since 2020. According to their CEO and founder, Jose Diaz, Riot Games selected teams based on whether or not they would be able to have a long-lasting partnership and be a stable company in the foreseeable future. However, the fight for a spot in the franchising league was not any better, as fighting for a spot was extremely difficult because of other organizations, such as Team Liquid, Acend, and Fnatic, going for a spot as well.
<br>
2) The article is somewhat easy to understand and the message is coveyed somewhat well to the readers. It does go a little in-depth about the details, however not too far into it. Something that was interesting about the article was how they selected teams for franchising. The criteria to make it into franchising makes sense, as it ensures no teams will drop out for whatever reason mid-season. However, it also means that, if you did go for a spot, the past of your company in any game or relationship with Riot Games can heavily affect whether or not you get in or not.</p>

		  <br> 2. I have played nitrotype, a game that was meant to help kids learn how to type faster. 
		  <br> 3. I have played many games that were meant for education, however the most notable ones were ABCYA and Nitrotype.
		  <br>4. I learned how to type faster and how to do multiplication mentally very fast.

		<a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2023/01/blizzard-games-offline-china-esports-implications">Article - Blizzard games have gone offline in China. What does it mean for esports?</a>
		<br>
1)  At midnight on January 24th, Blizzard games such as Overwatch, Hearthstone, and World of Warcraft have officially gone offline in China after Blizzard failed to negotiate an extension to their 14 year-old licensing relationship. Originally, the relationship was brought down in November of 2022, and has only been getting more bitter since then. However, on January 17th, Chinese social media site Weibo offered to extend the partnership for another 6 months while they looked for a new distribution partner. Netease rejected this offer, calling it "commercially illogical" because they had already fired their employees and closed its shared office. They retaliated this by smashing the Warcraft hammer statue at the headquarters, which was livestreamed on social media. The termination of the deal will be a mutual blow to both NetEase and Blizzard, the latter of which is still under pressure due to the recent sexual harassment lawsuits that have come to surface recently and legal issues with the Microsoft merger.
<br>
2) The article is kind of easy to understand, but stays pretty surface level in general. Something that was interesting about the article was why NetEase even retaliated the way they did in the first place. It only created more tension between everyone involved, which is helped no one.</p>

		<a href="https://valiantceo.com/the-importance-of-communication-in-esports/">Article - Winning With Communication: The Importance of Communication in Esports</a>
		<br>
1) How important is communication in esports? In other words, how does communication help with success in the gaming industry? There are many examples that can answer this question, however one of the most iconic comes from the 2013 League of Legends World Championships. In the finals match of the tournament, Korean-based team T1 won the series 3-0 against the Royal Club team. A T1 player had stated that they had not started off too well, but were able to make many comebacks despite this because of their excellent communication. On the other hand, the Royal Club was having many communication problems causing them to make poor decisions during the match. This shows that communication can make a huge difference between winning and losing. However, it can also be used to help team morale when players are starting to tilt. For instance, North American team Cloud 9 is famous for having very good morale due to their strong relays. Cloud 9 CEO and founder Jack Etinenne stated that they place a lot of emphasis on communication within their teams because he thinks it is one of the most important factors to a successful team. The examples of T1 and C9 are show that communicating with your teammates and coach is essential to win. To improve communication, you should be clear and concise, listen to your teammates, practice communicating in general, be patient, and be flexible.
<br>
2) How communication is important in League of Legends and Valorant and how different strategies could be viable for the respective games. I added that running a dual duelist composition may not be the best in the current meta.
	  <br>
3) I listen to my teammates relatively well and I am clear and concise when communicating. I could improve on being more flexible and being a little more patient. Our team needs to work on communication as a whole because we are not really working people's schedules when we play.

		<a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2023/02/valorant-capsule-vct-team-revenue">Article - New VALORANT capsule to provide VCT partner teams with revenue</a>
		<br>
1) A new VALORANT bundle has just recently been announced, which will help VCT partnered teams to make additional revenue during the event. The capsule contains different cosmetic items for each respective region to allow fans to support whoever they want to win. 50% of net proceeds made from the bundle from February 8th to March 7th will be shared among all of the participating teams competing in the Americas, Pacific, and EMEA regions. The franchised teams will be competing against each other in a single-elimination bracket in Sao Paulo for a share of $500,000 USD in prize money and a chance to earn a regional slot at the VCT Masters Event for this year. VCT is no stranger to sharing revenue with partnered teams, with the same happening last year when another limited-time bundle was released to do the same, generating over $16 Million in revenue shared among the teams.
<br>
2) The article is easy to understand and somewhat clearly conveys the message it is intended to send. It does go a little bit into it, but stays relatively surface level. Something that was interesting was how they're doing the event this year, as they have never done a single-elim bracket in previous tournaments, especially with it being the first event of 2023 in the official circuit. </p>

		<a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2023/02/wardell-rivalry-valorant-partnership">Article - Rivalry teams up with VALORANT player Wardell</a>
		<br>
1) Former TSM player Wardell has recently teamed up with Rivarly, an esports/sports betting company. The partnership aims to have numerous campaigns to activate his fanbase and the VALORANT community. Yu, who is known by his in-game name Wardell, is mostly known for his time in CS:GO with Ghost Gaming. He retired from CS:GO to pursue a career in VALORANT, which was the most recent FPS game to hit the market. During his professional career in VALORANT, Wardell competed under the TSM banner for just short of 2 years. The decision to partner with Rivarly came ahead of the 2023 VCT season, which starts on February 13th. The first piece of content that will be made between the two will see Wardell coach his fans and provide tips to help them improve their skills, as well as comment on match-ups and recent news in the VALORANT scene.
<br>
2) The article is easy to understand and the message is clearly conveyed to the reader. It does go in-depth of what they are going to do during the partnership, as well as a little background on Wardell and what he was known for. Something that was interesting was the fact that they started right before the new VCT season that started.</p>
