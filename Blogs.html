		<br>
1) VALORANT Game Changers in the EMEA circuit is set to have a number of changes going into the 2023 season. It is with this new format that new players in the region will have a new and possible path to becoming a professional player in the game. The renewed circuit will be divided into four tiers: VCT Game Changers EMEA: Emergents and VCT Game Changers EMEA: Academy, VCT Game Changers Contenders, VCT Game Changers EMEA, and finally the Game Changers Championships. According to Riot themselves, the new format aims to grow the Game Changers Community and continue to bolster the esports ecosystem for women and other gender minorities.
<br>
2) a. The message is conveyed very well and is easy to understand.
    b. It stays relatively on the surface-level of things, however does go a little in depth       about each series.
    c. Something that was interesting about the article was how the Game Changers side compares to the normal VCT, as the former uses a different format than that of the latter.</p>

		<a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2022/09/riot-games-unveils-full-list-of-valorant-champions-tour-off-season-tournaments">Article - Riot Games unveils full list of VALORANT Champions Tour off-season tournaments</a>
		<br>
		1) The article talks about the newly created VALORANT OFF//SEASON initiative, which aims to give third-party tournament organizers a way to host tournaments outside of their regular campaign. So tournaments such as the Knights Arena, which was originally an unofficial tournament that was not connected to Riot Games, will be able to hold it on a professional level. Because of these various [25] tournaments are off-season in multiple regions, this will allow, "...Riot to keep the VALORANT scene alive during the off-season, a time where roster moves and speculations usually happen. It will also allow tournament organizers to experiment more with formats and types of events, which will hopefully lead to interesting matches year-round."
		<br>
		2) It is a good article because it goes in depth on how it will be beneficial for not only tournament organizers but also the competitive season itself. Specifically, it will keep the scene alive throughout the off-season, as not much goes on aside from roster changes and such. It will also allow tournament organizers to have support from Riot themselves, as they will provide a dedicated information page about them as well as tips and advice on how to create your very own events.</p>

		<a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2023/01/fpx-valorant-rebrand-china">Article - FPX rebrands ZHUQUE team ahead of VALORANT China launch</a>
		<br>
		1) Having joined the VALORANT EU scene in 2020, the original FPX roster managed to claim a VCT Masters title and finished in the Top 4 of the 2022 Champions tournament. Despite this however, FPX was not able to make franchising in any region. Much like the former, the ZHUQUE team was also launched in 2020 in Asia as an official team, and has competed in low tier invitationals. And, as VALORANT is set to be launched in China, FPX signed the former ZHUQUE roster to compete under the FPX banner ahead of the release. However, this means that FPX will now be competing in the Asia scene rather than the EMEA region.
		<br>
	2) The article is very easy to understand, as it gives the more important details as well as some background on the ZHUQUE roster. It does stay surface level, however it is a good thing as it keeps the article easy to understand and rather minimalistic. Something that was interesting about the article was FPX's move to Asia ahead of VALORANT's launch in China. This is because they did very well in EMEA, and for how popular they were during the 2022 VCT season, could have easily signed players who did not get signed by a franchised team.</p>
