	<h1 style="font-family:calibri">The Ideal Exercise Plan
</h1>
	<h3 style="font-family:calibri">Many people think that exercising will produce improved results instantly every time. However, the reality is that it takes time to build yourself up. That doesn't mean you have to work out every hour of the day though. In fact, you might even finish working out in an hour because of how hard it might be. So to exercise yourself properly, you have to start out slow and easy, then make things harder overtime.
		<br>
		You may be asking at this point, so what? What exercises am I exactly supposed to start with? Well, there are two types we will be covering. Cardio, - workouts that help build overall stamina - and Strengthening - workouts that build the muscles in the body.
</h3>
	<br>
	<h1 style = "font-family:calibri">Cardio workouts will generally be easy, as they can be something you do in your day to day life or as an easy exercise. These workouts will help improve the circulation of oxygen in your blood to all of your muscles, causing stamina to improve as time goes on while still building some muscle.

Depending on what you may want to build more of, some exercises will do better at building a certain muscle than another. This type of workout somewhat relies on the Cardio workouts because you need the oxygen in your body to be circulated at a good speed in order to do these exercises for a longer amount of time.

It is also needed to provide the right nutrients that are required to construct new muscle. This means that what you eat and how much you intake is essential to gain muscles. If you don't have a diet plan while doing strengthening trainings and such, it can actually lead to the severe loss of muscle tissue. This also suggests that having junk foods can severely inhibit the progress you  could be making, as craving could easily takeover.
			<br><br>
			For the ideal plan however, you will want a good amount of everything. Whether it be fruits, vegetables, or meats, you do not want too much of one thing or the meal plan will not be balanced. You should try to have a relatively small snack in between each meal - such as breakfast and lunch - to replace some calories that may be lost throughout the day. <br><br>
